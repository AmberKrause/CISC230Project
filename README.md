# CISC230Project

This was a class project I completed during my Fall 2016 semester at the University of St. Thomas.

The server side is executed from the ServerDriver class. It will launch a set of dialog boxes that
allow the user to select a directory of shared files to make accessible to clients, add files to
this directory, remove files from this directory, and start/stop the server.

The client side is executed from the ClientDriver class. It will launch a set of dialog boxes that
allow the user to view and download the files that a server has shared.

Technologies Used: Java and TextPad 8
